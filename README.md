# Elastic Grid

In particle physics, phonons are quasi-particles that symbolize packet of energy leaving a system of condensed matter.

I studied a little bit of quantum mechanics and solid state electronic, during last year, and my mind wandered a little bit.
Can I represent a grid of particles, each moving around like in real like, and make it look pretty? At least I tried.

This video is the usual outcome of bad programming practices mixed with some javascript and my [good ol' HTML5 boilerplate](https://github.com/lorossi/empty-html5-canvas-project).
Take a look at it on my [Instagram profile](https://wwww.instagram.com/lorossi) or, as always, clone the repo and view it comfortably on your own pc.

## What are you on about?

Atoms move. Nice.

I move. Nice.

A bridge moves. Less nice.

This video is smooth. Very very nice.
